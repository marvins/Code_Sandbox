This is a fairly helpful config file parser that I use in a crunch.  Feel free to update or modify.  
All I ask is that if the change is really useful, let me add it to the main code. 

This parser is modeled off of the Boost Program Options parser.  Mine is much, much simpler and 
sooner or later I will incorporate it back in.

Useful unit test code

Check out the Math/Geometry project for a use of the unit test code

Colors.h/.cpp : Useful functions which will modify the console terminal color. This can create colorful output which allows rapid viewing of pass/fail conditions.

Logger.h/.cpp : A log container which will store unit test results until all tests have completed. Useful for storing intermediate results rather than crash the results.

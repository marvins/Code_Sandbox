General mathematical utilities

Please send any recommendations to me so that I can fix them.


CORE
    - Vector: A generic vector library

GEOMETRY
    - Quaternion: A quaternion library for managing rotations

CALCULUS
    - Runge Kutta: A basic integration tool.  I am eventually going to implement this, as
    I never saved my initial classroom example.
